# Summary
This README is currently being used to log my progress as a way to reflect on the process of putting together this project. Some information may be used in the presentation. The rest of it is essentially drivel.

# Timeline of Events
### Last week
- I found an API called Spoonacular, which I found was highly recommended for applications involving food. After doing a bit of exploration, I decided to stick with it and spent a some time figuring out what data I wanted it to get for me.
- Around the end of the week, I decided to move on to real data by using some old recipe costing and menu engineering Excel spreadsheets.
- I found the Google Cloud for Developers documentation verbose and ultimately too confusing to rely on.
- It was also the weekend after class. I needed a break.
### Monday
- With the start of a new work week, I tried again with Google's documentation and related articles. I'd found that, much to my chagrin, some of the pages and examples I'd been attempting to follow for several hours, *in the official documentation*, ended up being outdated. Well then..
- I did some more toying around with Spoonacular
- Feeling stuck, I searched through GitHub for some more recent examples from developers working with Google Sheets, and this is when I found GSpread.
- After a bit more exploration, I found an article that walked me through it. Finally on the right track.
### Tuesday
- Using GSpread and Google Sheets, I found out how to turn the recipe costing sheet into a dataframe. However, it required that I make adjustments to the format I originally used in Excel. It's worth mentioning that these spreadsheets were first created almost 15 years ago.
### Wednesday
- Following that, I did the same with another sheet for menu engineering.
    - Again, it had to be modified in order to be easier to work with in Python.
- While working on the project, I started using a pomodoro timer extension for Chrome. Then I wondered about making a timer with Python.
    - [Creating a Simple Timer in Python and Using it with Programs in turtle](https://www.codetoday.co.uk/post/creating-a-simple-timer-in-python-and-using-it-with-programs-in-turtle)
- After browsing the "codetoday" website a bit, I also found this interesting use of turtle.
    - [Create a Halloween Animation with Python - a Tutorial](https://www.codetoday.co.uk/post/create-a-halloween-animation-with-python-a-tutorial)
    - This gave me an idea, but remains to be seen if anything will come of it.
