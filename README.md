# Easy as Py

## Summary

The goal of this project is to create an easy-to-use application that aids chefs and restaurant managers to evaluate and share useful metric data. Many restaurants - especially older but more established ones - still rely on a combination of outdated Microsoft Office programs and good old pen and paper. Python can bridge the gap between analog and older systems, and complex digital point of sales systems and ERP programs, to make the business side of food service management easy as pie.

This will be a continued WIP in collaboration with my brother Jeffrey Salazar, executive chef at Chardonnay's Restaurant.
